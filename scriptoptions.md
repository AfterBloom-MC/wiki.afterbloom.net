# Script Options

In PySpigot's main plugin folder, you'll find a file titled `script_options.yml`. This file enables you to specify various script-specific options, all of which are covered here.

!> Defining script options for each script is *optional*; see the [Defaults](#defaults) section for more info.

## Basic Format

If you would like to specify options for a script, do it like so:

``` yaml
test.py:
  enabled: true
```

Each section in the `script_options.yml` file should be the name of a script. The name must *exactly* match the script's name, (including `.py`), or the options won't be parsed for that script. All options within the section apply to the script by which the section is named. In the above example, the option `enabled` applies to the script `test.py`.

If you would like to define options for multiple scripts, do it like so:

``` yaml
test.py:
  enabled: true
  file-logging-enabled: true
test2.py:
  enabled: true
  depend: ['test.py']
```

As you can see, in the above code snippet, we define a new section titled `test2.py`, and all options within this section will apply to the `test2.py` script. All options within the `test.py` script apply to the script `test.py`.

## Defaults

Specifying script options for each script is not a requirement. Furthermore, you may omit certain script options if you do not wish to set them. All options have default values, as outlined above, and if you do not explicitly define certain options (or any options), the default values will be used.

If a script does not have any script options defined in `script_options.yml`, then the default values will be used for all script options.

## Options

### enabled

Used to enable or disable a script. To disable a script, set this value to `false`.

Default: `true` (enabled)
Usage:
``` yaml
test.py:
  enabled: true
```

### depend

Used to specify a list of other scripts that this script requires to load. This will ensure the script loads *after* all of its dependency scripts are loaded. Furthermore, if any of the script's dependencies are missing, the script will not load. To list a dependency, use the full name of the script (including `.py`).

?> This value is a list (even if there is only one item!), and it should be formatted as `depend: ['item1', 'item2', 'item3', ...]`

Default: None
Usage:
``` yaml
test.py:
  depend: ['test1.py', 'test2.py']
```

### file-logging-enabled

Specify if script file logging should be enabled for the script. If this option is `true`, a script log file will be generated for the script, and any error messages (and print messages sent to the script's logger) will be logged to this file. If this option is `false`, no messages will be logged to file, but messages will still be printed to the server console.

Default: `log-to-file` value in PySpigot's `config.yml`, which is `true` by default
Usage:
``` yaml
test.py:
  file-logging-enabled: true
```

### min-logging-level

Specify the minimum logging level that should be logged to the script's log file and the console for the script. Options can be found on the [Javadocs](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/logging/Level.html).

Default: `min-log-level` value in PySpigot's `config.yml`, which is `INFO` by default
Usage:
``` yaml
test.py:
  min-log-level: 'INFO'
```
