# Planned Features

PySpigot is an evolving project. I have several features planned for future releases. This is a non-comprehensive list of features I plan on adding in the future:

- Add more example scripts, including one that demonstrates how to create a GUI menu
- Add support for MySQL, Postgres, MonogDB, redis, and other databases
- Add support for autocompletion in IDE/text editor when writing scripts
- Add support for calling PySpigot methods from scripts with \*args and \*kwargs (both non-keyword and keyword arguments)
- Script loading delay on a per-script basis
- Support for scripts on BungeeCord/Waterfall/Velocity proxy server
- Add per-script metrics (uptime, number of listeners registered, commands registered, etc.) that can be viewed via command
- :heavy_check_mark: ~~Ability to create and send packets via protocol manager (through ProtocolLib)~~
- :heavy_check_mark: ~~Allow scripts to stop themselves as well as start/stop other scripts (via script manager)~~
- :heavy_check_mark: ~~Per-script logging (log to file as well as to console for each script)~~
- :heavy_check_mark: ~~Overhaul access to PySpigot's managers~~
- :heavy_check_mark: ~~Add "stop" function to all scripts that will be called when a script is stopped or unloaded~~
