Sensitive or identifying information is not collected.</p> <p>If you would like to opt out of this feature, set <code>metrics-enabled</code> to <code>false</code> in PySpigot's config file. Alternatively, you can disable bStats server-wide by setting <code>enabled</code> to <code>false</code> in /plugins/bStats/config.yml.</p>"},{"location":"#licensing-information","title":"Licensing Information","text":"<p>PySpigot is licensed using the Apache 2.0 license.
