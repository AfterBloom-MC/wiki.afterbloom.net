# Defining Tasks

Through PySpigot, scripts can interact with Bukkit's task scheduler and schedule/run synchronous and asynchronous tasks. These allow you to run code at later times, at intervals, repeating, and on a thread other than the main server thread. The task manager also has built-in support for asynchronous tasks with synchronous callbacks.

For instructions on importing the task manager into your script, visit the [General Information](usage.md) page.

    This is not a comprehensive guide to scheduling tasks. For a more complete guide to tasks and scheduler programming, see Bukkit's tutorial on using the scheduler [here](https://bukkit.fandom.com/wiki/Scheduler_Programming). Note that much of this information pertains to writing plugins in Java, but the general ideas are nevertheless helpful to understand.

## Task Manager Usage

There are several functions in the task manager available for you to use in your script:

- `runTask(function, functionArgs)`: Run a synchronous task as soon as possible. Takes the function to call when the task runs. Also takes any number of arguments that should be passed to the function when the task runs.
- `runTaskAsync(function, functionArgs)`: Run an asychronous task (a task on a thread other than the main server thread). Takes the function to call when the task runs. Also takes any number of arguments that should be passed to the function when the task runs.
- `runTaskLater(function, delay, functionArgs)`: Run a synchronous task at some point in the future after the specified delay. Takes the function to call when the task runs and the delay to wait (in ticks) before running the task. Also takes any number of arguments that should be passed to the function when the task runs.
- `runTaskLaterAsync(function, delay, functionArgs)`: Run an asynchronous task at some point in the future after the specified delay. Takes the function to call when the task runs and the delay to wait (in ticks) before running the task. Also takes any number of arguments that should be passed to the function when the task runs.
- `scheduleRepeatingTask(function, delay, interval, functionArgs)`: Run a synchronous repeating task that repeats every specified interval. Takes the function to call each time the task runs, the delay to wait (in ticks) before running the task, and the interval (in ticks) at which the task should be run. Also takes any number of arguments that should be passed to the function when the task runs.
- `scheduleAsyncRepeatingTask(function, delay, interval, functionArgs)`: Run an asynchronous repeating task that repeats every specified interval. Takes the function to call each time the task runs, the delay to wait (in ticks) before running the task, and the interval (in ticks) at which the task should be run. Also takes any number of arguments that should be passed to the function when the task runs.
- `runSyncCallbackTask(function, callback, functionArgs)`: Schedules an asynchronous task with a synchronous callback. Takes the function to call for the asynchronous portion, and another function to call for the synchronous portion. Also takes any number of arguments that should be passed to the function (asynchronous portion) when the task runs.
- `runSyncCallbackTaskLater(function, callback, delay, functionArgs)`: Schedules an asynchronous task with a synchronous callback to run at some point in the future after the specified delay. Takes the function to call for the asynchronous portion, another function to call for the synchronous portion, and the delay to wait (in ticks) before running the task. Also takes any number of arguments that should be passed to the function (asynchronous portion) when the task runs.
- `stopTask(id)`: Stop/Cancel a task. Takes the id of the task to stop.

Any time a task is scheduled, a task id (`int`) is returned. This can be used to cancel the task later if desired.

In the above functions, `functionArgs` is an optional argument. If the function to call does not accept any arguments, you do not need to specify any.

???+ note

    20 ticks of in-game time is one real-world second (in a server without TPS lag). Therefore, one tick is equal to 1/20 of a second.

## Basic Code Example

Let's take a look at the following code that defines and starts a synchronous repeating task:

``` py linenums="1"
import pyspigot as ps # (1)!

a_string = 'Test'

def run_task(arg): # (2)!
    #Do something...

task_id = ps.scheduler.scheduleRepeatingTask(run_task, 0, 100, a_string) # (3)!
```

1. Here, we import PySpigot as `ps` to utilize the task manager (`scheduler`).

2. Here, we define a function called `run_task` that takes one argument.

3. Here, we register our task as a synchronous repeating task with the task manager, passing the `run_task` function, our desired delay (0 ticks), our desired interval (100 ticks), and the variable we want to pass to the task function each time the task is ran (the `a_string` variable we defined earlier on line 3). We then assign the returned value to `task_id`, an `int` that is the ID of the task that was registered. This ID can be used to cancel/stop the task later.

Like listeners, all tasks must be registered and run with PySpigot's task manager. There are many different ways to start tasks depending on if we want the task to be synchronous, ascynchronous, and/or repeating, but here we want our task to be synchronous and repeating, so we use `scheduleRepeatingTask(function, delay, interval, functionArgs)`, which in this case takes four arguments:

- The first argument accepts the function that should be called when the task runs (either once or repeatedly at a fixed interval).
- The second argument is the delay (in ticks) that the scheduler should wait before starting the task when it is registered.
- The third argument is the interval (in ticks) that the task should be run.
- The final arguments (fourth only in this case) are used to specify the arguments that should be passed to the function.

### Passing Multiple Arguments to a Task's Function

If we wanted `run_task` in the above example to take two arguments instead of one, we would modify the code like so:

``` py linenums="1"
import pyspigot as ps

a_string = 'Test'
another_string = 'Test 2'

def run_task(arg, arg2):
    #Do something...

task_id = ps.scheduler.scheduleRepeatingTask(run_task, 0, 100, a_string, another_string)
```

This example is very similar to the first, except that we define another string (`another_string`) and pass it (along with `a_string`) to the task manager when we register the task on line 8. These two strings are then passed, in order, to `run_task` when it is called by the task.

As you can see, all arguments to be passed are added at the end of the function that registers the task, in the appropriate order that they should be passed.

## Callback Tasks

The task manager also includes a callback task, which is a special task that runs asynchronously, then runs another synchronous task upon completion of the asynchronous task. This task type is quite useful in situations where you want to do work asynchronously, and then process the result of that work in a sychronous context. For example, consider a situation where a server has an SQL database that stores player data. When a player joins, the data should be fetched from the database asynchronously to avoid server lag, but it can't be applied to the player asynchronously, since all interaction with Bukkit and the server should be done synchronously. Therefore, a synchronous callback is useful in this situation to bring the data that was obtained from the database back to the main server thread for further processing and to apply it to the player.

### Callback Task Example

The following is a simple example of how to use a callback task:

``` py linenums="1"
import pyspigot as ps

def async_task():
    print('Asynchronous!')
    data = 'some data'
    return data

def sync_task(data):
    print('Synchronous!')
    print(data)

ps.scheduler.runSyncCallbackTask(async_task, sync_task)
```

The following conosle output is observed:

```
[STDOUT] Asynchronous!
[STDOUT] Synchronous!
[STDOUT] some data
```

There are a few things to note regarding this example:

- **First**, there are separate functions defined for the asynchronous and synchronous portions of the callback task.
- **Second**, the asynchronous task happens *first*, and the synchronous task will not begin execution until the asynchronous task *finishes*.
- **Third**, any data returned from the asynchrounous portion of the task (such as the return statement on line 6 of the above example) is passed as a function argument to the synchronous portion of the task (`sync_task` above takes the argument `data`). This allows for synchronous processing of whatever data was retrieved in the asynchronous portion of the task.

## Summary

- Like listeners, tasks are defined as functions in your script. Task can take any number of arguments, including zero.
- Tasks can pass arguments on to the function they call. Specify these arguments when you register your task with the task manager.
- All tasks must be registered with PySpigot's task manager. For example, to schedule and run a synchronous repeating task, use `scheduler.scheduleRepeatingTask(function, delay, interval, functionArgs)`.
