# Planned Features

PySpigot is an evolving project. I have several features planned for future releases. This is a non-comprehensive list of features I plan on adding in the future:

- [ ] Add more example scripts, including one that demonstrates how to create a GUI menu
- [ ] Add support for autocompletion in IDE/text editor when writing scripts
- [ ] Add support for calling PySpigot methods from scripts with \*args and \*kwargs (both non-keyword and keyword arguments)
- [ ] Script loading delay on a per-script basis
- [ ] Support for scripts on BungeeCord/Waterfall/Velocity proxy server
- [x] Add support for MySQL, Postgres, MonogDB, redis, and other databases
- [x] Add per-script metrics (uptime, number of listeners registered, commands registered, etc.) that can be viewed via command
- [x] Ability to create and send packets via protocol manager (through ProtocolLib)
- [x] Allow scripts to stop themselves as well as start/stop other scripts (via script manager)
- [x] Per-script logging (log to file as well as to console for each script)
- [x] Overhaul access to PySpigot's managers
- [x] Add "stop" function to all scripts that will be called when a script is stopped or unloaded
