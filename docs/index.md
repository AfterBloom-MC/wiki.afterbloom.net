See the [Quick Start Guide](pyspigot/quickstart.md) for a brief tutorial. Check out the rest of the documentation for more advanced usage.

## Discord

PySpigot has an official Discord server with help channels, bug reporting, and more. I'm usually active on Discord, so if you want to reach me, joining the Discord server is an excellent way to do so. [Join the Discord server here.](https://discord.gg/f2u7nzRwuk)

## Metrics

PySpigot uses [bStats](https://bstats.org/) to collect anonymous usage data for PySpigot. I use these data to inform me about PySpigot's users, including which country they are from (so that I can offer support in popular non-English languages) as well as what Minecraft and Java versions are most popular with users. bStats also collects some other useful data, including server software (Spigot, Paper, Purpur, etc.), plugin version, and number of scripts loaded. Sensitive or identifying information is not collected.

If you would like to opt out of this feature, set `metrics-enabled` to `false` in PySpigot's config file. Alternatively, you can disable bStats server-wide by setting `enabled` to `false` in /plugins/bStats/config.yml.
