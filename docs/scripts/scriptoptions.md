# Script Options

In PySpigot's main plugin folder, you'll find a file titled `script_options.yml`. This file enables you to specify various script-specific options, all of which are covered here.

???+ tip

    Defining script options for each script is *optional*. See the [Defaults](#defaults) section for more information.

## Basic Format

If you would like to specify options for a script, do it like so:

``` yaml linenums="1"
test.py: # (1)!
  enabled: true
  file-logging-enabled: true
```

1.  All options defined under this section apply to the script `test.py` only.

Each section in the `script_options.yml` file should be the name of a script. The name must *exactly* match the script's name, (including `.py`), or the options won't be parsed for that script.

All options within the section apply to the script by which the section is named. In the above example, the options `enabled` and `file-logging-enabled` apply to the script `test.py`.

### Defining Options for Multiple Scripts

If you would like to define options for multiple scripts, do it like so:

``` yaml linenums="1"
test.py: # (1)!
  enabled: true
  file-logging-enabled: true
test2.py: # (2)!
  enabled: true
  depend: ['test.py']
```

1.  The options defined under this section apply to the script `test.py`.
2.  The options defined under this section apply to the script `test2.py`.

As you can see, in the above example, we define a new section titled `test2.py`, and all options within this section will apply to the `test2.py` script. All options within the `test.py` script still apply only to the script `test.py`.

## Defaults

Specifying script options for each script is not a requirement. PySpigot relies on fallbacks as well as default values for script options in the event that they aren't defined in the `script_options.yml` file for the script that is being loaded. The following diagram illustrates the process by which PySpigot searches for script options when a script loads.

``` mermaid
graph LR
  A[Script loads] --> B{Option present in script_options.yml?};
  B -->|Yes| C[Use option from script_options.yml]
  B -->|No| D{Default option present in config.yml?}
  D -->|Yes| E[Use default option defined in config.yml]
  D -->|No| F[Use internal default option]
```

PySpigot first checks if an option is present in the `script_options.yml` file. If the option isn't defined here, then it will fall back to whatever default value is defined in the [`config.yml` under `script-option-defaults`](../pyspigot/pluginconfiguration.md/#script-option-defaults). If a default option isn't specified here, then it will fall back to an internally defined default value.

PySpigot performs this process for **each script option** individually.

## Options

### `enabled`

Specify whether a script is enabled or disabled. To disable a script, set this value to `false`.

``` yaml linenums="1"
test.py:
  enabled: true
```

**Default:** `true`

### `load-priority`

Specify an integer load priority for the script. Scripts are loaded in order from highest to lowest load priority. In other words, scripts that have a higher load priority are loaded earlier, and scripts with a lower load priority are loaded later. If multiple scripts have the same load priority, they are loaded in alphabetical order. To list a dependency, use the full name of the script (including `.py`).

``` yaml linenums="1"
test.py:
  load-priority: 1
```

**Default:** 1

### `plugin-depend`

Specify a list of plugins that this script requires to load. The script will not load if any of the plugin dependencies are not loaded and running on the server. Additionally, when a plugin is unloaded/disabled, any scripts that depend on that plugin as specified under this option are automatically unloaded (if the `script-unload-on-plugin-disable` option in the `config.yml` is set to `true`).

``` yaml linenums="1"
test.py:
  plugin-depend: ['Citizens', 'Vault']
```

???+ notice

    If you are working with ProtocolLib or PlaceholderAPI in your script, you **do not** need to specify either of them here. PySpigot has built-in support for these two plugins, and the dependency management is handled internally.

**Default:** None (empty list)

### `file-logging-enabled`

Specify if script file logging should be enabled for the script. If this option is `true`, a script log file will be generated for the script, and any error messages (and print messages sent to the script's logger) will be logged to this file. If this option is `false`, no messages will be logged to file, but messages will still be printed to the server console.

``` yaml linenums="1"
test.py:
  file-logging-enabled: true
```

**Default:** `true`

### `min-logging-level`

Specify the minimum logging level that should be logged to the script's log file and the console for the script. Options can be found on the [JavaDocs](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/logging/Level.html).

``` yaml linenums="1"
test.py:
  min-log-level: 'INFO'
```

**Default:** `INFO`

### `permissions`

Specify a list of permissions that the script uses. This is useful for scripts that want to restrict access to certain features. This section is defined in the [exact same way](https://docs.papermc.io/paper/dev/plugin-yml#permissions) that permissions are defined in the `plugin.yml` file for a Bukkit plugin. See usage code example below for how to define permissions, defaults, and child permissions.

``` yaml linenums="1"
test.py:
  permissions:
    permission.node.*:
      description: 'This is a permission node'
      default: op
      children:
        permission.node.child: true
    permission.node.child:
      description: 'This is a child permission node'
      default: true
    another.permission.node:
      description: 'This is another permission node'
      default: not op
```

- `description` is a description of the permission node, and this is what will be displayed in the permissions list. The default value is the name of the permission node.
- `default` is the default value of the permission node, or, in other words, who should have the permission node by default. There are four possible values for `default`: 
  - `op`: Only server operators will have the permission node by default.
  - `not op`: Players who are not operators will have the permission node by default.
  - `true`: All players will have the permission (I.E. it is a default permission).
  - `false`: No players will have the permission (I.E. it is *not* a default permission). The default value is the value of `default_permission` (outlined below).
- `children` is a list of child permissions that should inherit from the parent permission. Each permission node may have children. When set to `true`, the child will inherit the parent permission.

**Default:** None (no permissions defined)

### `permission-default`

Specify a default value that permissions should have, if they do not have a `default` value defined.

``` yaml linenums="1"
test.py:
  permission-default: true
```

The allowed values for `permission-default` are `op`, `not op`, `true`, and `false`:

- `op`: Only server operators will have the permission node by default.
- `not op`: Players who are not operators will have the permission node by default.
- `true`: All players will have the permission (I.E. it is a default permission).
- `false`: No players will have the permission (I.E. it is *not* a default permission). 

**Default:** `op`
