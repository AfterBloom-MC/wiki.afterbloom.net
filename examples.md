# Example Scripts

Below is a curated list of example scripts that perform various functions. You are free to use any code from any of these examples.

- [`kickcommand.py`](https://github.com/magicmq/PySpigot/blob/master/examples/kickcommand.py): Registers a simple command to kick a player from the server
- [`periodicmessage.py`](https://github.com/magicmq/PySpigot/blob/master/examples/periodicmessage.py): Creates a task that automatically sends a message to all online players every five seconds
- [`swearfilter.py`](https://github.com/magicmq/PySpigot/blob/master/examples/swearfilter.py): Creates a chat listener that filters swear words out of the message
	- This script relies on a configuration file called `swearfilter.yml` that isn't included. Create it yourself!
