# PySpigot

> A Python scripting engine for your Minecraft server.

## What is PySpigot?

PySpigot is a Python scripting engine that allows you to write Python scripts that can interface with Bukkit and other parts of a Minecraft server seamlessly, without writing a plugin. Scripts have full access to the Java class path at runtime (meaning anything is possible!) and also have access to PySpigot's managers, which help make writing scripts much easier.

## Features

- Load scripts on server start and via commands
- Stop, reload, and unload server scripts via commands
- Register event listeners
- Register commands
- Schedule tasks (synchronous and asynchronous)
- Work with config files
- Register ProtocolLib packet listeners
- Register PlaceholderAPI placeholder expansions
- Comprehensive logging of errors and exceptions on a per-script basis, to file
- Load Java libraries you'd like to work with at runtime
- Write scripts in Python syntax
- Scripts have complete access to the Bukkit/Spigot API, as well as APIs of other plugins, so anything is possible.
- And more!
