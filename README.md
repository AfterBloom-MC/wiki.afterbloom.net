# PySpigot

> A Python scripting engine for your Minecraft server.

## What is PySpigot?

PySpigot is a Python scripting engine that allows you to write Python scripts that can interface with Bukkit and other parts of a Minecraft server seamlessly, without writing a plugin. Scripts have full access to the Java class path at runtime (meaning anything is possible!) and also have access to PySpigot's managers, which help make writing scripts much easier.

## Features

- Write python scripts that can be dynamically loaded/unloaded on server start or at any time
- Register commands
- Write to and read from config files
- Write event listeners
- Schedule tasks with the task manager
- Support for registering packet listeners through ProtocolLib
- Load Java libraries at any time for scripts to work with
- Comprehensive logging of script errors/exceptions
- And much more!
